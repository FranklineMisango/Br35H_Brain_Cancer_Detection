# Brain Tumor Project

## Brief Description

This project is a combination of Manually Trained and pretrained VGG16, Google's LeNET & EfficientNetB7 models to comprehensively address the Brain Tumor segmentation procedure. I compare the Two main widely implemented models : VGG16 & EfficientNetModel7 and Curate a simple web application to allow the Medical Practitioner client to use the most efficent model or choose either for the matter

## Abstract

A Brain tumor is considered as one of the aggressive diseases, among children and adults. Brain tumors account for 85 to 90 percent of all primary Central Nervous System(CNS) tumors. Every year, around 11,700 people are diagnosed with a brain tumor. The 5-year survival rate for people with a cancerous brain or CNS tumor is approximately 34 percent for men and36 percent for women. Brain Tumors are classified as: Benign Tumor, Malignant Tumor, Pituitary Tumor, etc. Proper treatment, planning, and accurate diagnostics should be implemented to improve the life expectancy of the patients. The best technique to detect brain tumors is Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). A huge amount of image data is generated through the scans. These images are examined by the radiologist. A manual examination can be error-prone due to the level of complexities involved in brain tumors and their properties.Application of automated classification techniques using Machine Learning(ML) and Artificial Intelligence(AI)has consistently shown higher accuracy than manual classification. Hence, proposing a system performing detection and classification by using Deep Learning Algorithms using Convolution-Neural Network (CNN), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Transfer-Learning (TL) would be helpful to doctors all around the world.

## Context
Brain Tumors are complex. There are a lot of abnormalities in the sizes and location of the brain tumor(s). This makes it really difficult for complete understanding of the nature of the tumor. Also, a professional Neurosurgeon is required for MRI analysis. Often times in developing countries the lack of skillful doctors and lack of knowledge about tumors makes it really challenging and time-consuming to generate reports from MRIâ€™. So an automated system on Cloud can solve this problem.

## Definition

To Detect and Classify Brain Tumor using, CNN and TL; as an asset of Deep Learning and to examine the tumor position(segmentation).

# The Data-Set

The Dataset folder contains MRI data. The images are already split into Training and Testing folders.
Each folder has more four subfolders. These folders have MRIs of respective tumor classes.
The Dataset was download from kaggle, and it is publicly available and has no use restriction.

**2. Model Development and Fine-tuning**

The following parameters namely: Batch size, Epochs, Dropout and Optimizer, of the model where fined, and the visualisation of the results are below

The following values and parameters where chosen:

- **_Optimizers_** -  Five optimizers have been chosen , namely ; `1. SGD,2. RMSprop,3. Adam,4. Adagrad,5. Adadelta.` the best optimizer will be used in the New model and as step 1 for the webapp

- **_Number of epochs_** - Epochs variation ; `1, 2, 5, 10.`

- **_Batch size_** - Batch size variation; `8, 16.`

- **_Dropout_** - Drop out values by order  `0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9`

**4. Conclusions**

After comparing VGG16 and EfficientNetB7, The results are as below : 


| **Requirement(%)**     |   **Accuracy (%)**        |
| ---------------------- |  ------------------------ |
| `EfficientNet`         |                           |
| `VGG16 `               |                           |

Therefore, the most efficient model is the EfficientNet despite the longer training time
